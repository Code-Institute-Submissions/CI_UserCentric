                    <p> We honestly believe that the coffee world is boundless and barely explored by the everyday regular drinker.
                        There are plenty of spots in the city where you can grab a cup and mozzy on, but... Forget about
                        the commercial coffee haunts - we are talking about inviting you into a sacred shrine, a dedicated
                        research laboratory, a pleasant environment where your curiosity (and tastebuds) are encouraged.

                        savoury dishes. As we all know, coffee is a rich in variation. However, one must know how to appreciate
                        and enjoy it as it deserves. </p>

                    <p>
                        The Chemex is what all those other coffeemakers strive to be. Invented in 1941, it has never needed to be altered or improved
                        upon. Winning awards in both the design and science communities, being kept in permanent collection
                        of some of the most prestigious museums in the world, are just a couple pieces of its iconic history
                        that none of the others can boast. Widely considered to be one of the best ways to brew the perfect
                        cup of coffee; the Chemex has been the choice of coffee lovers globally for over 75 years and counting. (Extract from Chemex' official website)
