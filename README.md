# Vero's Dazzling Cafe Experience
### User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project

### Guidelines & To do List

#### Use the following guidelines when developing your project:

- [x] Create a website of around 4-5 pages, or (if using a single scrolling page) these should be separate page areas. 
__Status__: Done

- [x] Incorporate main navigation and grid layout (you might want to use Flexbox or Bootstrap to accomplish this). 
__Status__: Done

- [x] Whenever possible, strive to use semantic HTML5 elements to structure your HTML code better. __Status__: Done

- [x] Make sure your site is as responsive as possible. You can test this by checking the website on different screen sizes and browsers. 
__Status__: *In progress* 

- [x] We advise that you write down user stories and create wireframes/mockups before embarking on full-blown development. 
__Status__: Done

- [x] The site can also make use of CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap, just make sure you maintain a clear separation between the library code and your code. 
__Status__: No framework used so far

- [ ] You should conduct and document tests to ensure that all of your websiteâ€™s functionality works well. 
__Status__: *In progress*

- [x] Write a README.md file for your project that explains what the project does and the need that it fulfills. It should also describe the functionality of the project, as well as the technologies used. Detail how the project was deployed and tested and if some of the work was based on other code, explain what was kept and how it was changed to fit your need. A project submitted without a README.md file will FAIL. 
__Status__: 75% done

- [x] Use Git & GitHub for version control. Each new piece of functionality should be in a separate commit. 
__Status__: Repository created, commiting changes

- [x] Deploy the final version of your code to a hosting platform such as GitHub Pages. 
__Status__: almost-final version accessible

Initially I intended to use Bootstrap or Flexbox to organise the content of the website, but then I came across a really interesting article regarding css grids using "calc()" [http://zerosixthree.se/create-css-grid-using-calc/]and [https://css-tricks.com/a-couple-of-use-cases-for-calc/]. I decided to try using this for the first project at least, for a personal challenge.

I wanted to use HTML and CSS only, but I really like to use SASS to organise the styles and keep track of what is left to do. I was inspired by [https://sass-guidelin.es/#architecture] SASS 7-1 file pattern.
