# Vero's Dazzling Cafe Experience

#### User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project


## Project published here [https://nuagesdencre.github.io/CI_UserCentric/]  
### About this project
The purpose of this website is to advertise and inform potential customers about coffee tastings and coffee-related events. This website is the virtual access for customers to prepare their visit to the Dazzling Cafe. 

### Functionality of the Project

Initially I intended to use Bootstrap or Flexbox to organise the content of the website, but then I came across a really interesting article regarding css grids using "calc()" [http://zerosixthree.se/create-css-grid-using-calc/]and [https://css-tricks.com/a-couple-of-use-cases-for-calc/]. I decided to try using this for the first project at least, for a personal challenge.

Please review [the mobile wireframe](ux/mobile_usercentric.pdf) and [the desktop wireframe](ux/desktop_usercentric.pdf).


I wanted to use HTML and CSS only, but I really like to use SASS to organise the styles and keep track of what is left to do. I was inspired by [https://sass-guidelin.es/#architecture] SASS 7-1 file pattern.

and computers.
