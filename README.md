# Vero's Dazzling Cafe Experience

## User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project


## Project published here [https://nuagesdencre.github.io/CI_UserCentric/]  
### About this project
The purpose of this website is to advertise and inform potential customers about coffee tastings and coffee-related events. This website is the virtual access for customers to prepare their visit to the Dazzling Cafe. 

### Functionality of the Project

Initially I intended to use Bootstrap or Flexbox to organise the content of the website, but then I came across a really interesting article regarding css grids using "calc()" [http://zerosixthree.se/create-css-grid-using-calc/]and [https://css-tricks.com/a-couple-of-use-cases-for-calc/]. I decided to try using this for the first project at least, for a personal challenge.

Please review [the mobile wireframe](ux/mobile_usercentric.pdf) and [the desktop wireframe](ux/desktop_usercentric.pdf).
##### Detail how the project was deployed and tested and if some of the work was based on other code, explain what was kept and how it was changed to fit your need.

I wanted to use HTML and CSS only, but I really like to use SASS to organise the styles and keep track of what is left to do. I was inspired by [https://sass-guidelin.es/#architecture] SASS 7-1 file pattern.
